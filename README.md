# IFCBParticleSize
Understanding and exploring the effect of particle settling on IFCB data. Also includes some basic functions for ingesting IFCB data


Empyrical analysis contains tools that can be used to explore existing IFCB data some work needs to be done to make these more general and able to loop over large directories of data


Modeling contains tools to model the movement of particles within the IFCB syringe
